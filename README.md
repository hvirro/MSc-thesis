# Quantifying Urban Expansion In Estonia
This repository holds the data, scripts and tools related to my master's thesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a [model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274097530_Urban_land_density_function_A_new_method_to_characterize_urban_expansion), originally developed in China, to quantify urban expansion in the context of Estonian cities. The model proposed an urban land density (ULD) function and provided derived indicators to measure the compactness and urban expansion of the cities.

The repo is divided into three parts:
* [uld-model](https://github.com/hvirro/MSc-thesis/tree/master/uld-model) - the data and ArcGIS tools that were used to extract urban land density data from the land use rasters of the four Estonian cities observed in this study;
* [data-analysis](https://github.com/hvirro/MSc-thesis/tree/master/data-analysis) - the data and scripts used for model fitting and the calculation of the compactness and urban sprawl indicators;
* [figures](https://github.com/hvirro/MSc-thesis/tree/master/figures) - figures showing the interfaces of the tools, the contents of the geodatabase, etc.

[This poster](https://github.com/hvirro/MSc-thesis/blob/master/Virro_ESRI_2018.pdf) gives a brief overview of my thesis. The poster was presented at the Esri User Conference 2018 in San Diego (USA), as I was one of the winners of the [Esri Young Scholars Award](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=0e2134811d094a0482936a5af5242b73).
